# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Program

## Projects

### 2. Classical Planning
This project is split between implementation and analysis. First you will combine symbolic logic and classical search to implement an agent that performs progression search to solve planning problems. Then you will experiment with different search algorithms and heuristics, and use the results to answer questions about designing planning systems.

### 3. Game Playing
In this project you will choose an experiment with adversarial game-playing techniques like minimax, Monte Carlo tree search, opening books, and more. Your goal will be to build and evaluate the performance of your agent in a finite deterministic two player game of perfect information called Isolation.
